# 308-Digital_Recognition-learn_how_to_start_a_baseline

- **Handwritten digit recognition is one of the more basic classification tasks in deep learning, and is used for introductory learning, If you encounter errors in the code or have questions about the code, please leave a comment to discuss!**

1. There are 3 tasks in total, starting with MLP and then using timm to call the current popular CNN or VIT models for classification

2. Tasks include SWA, TTA, model fusion, oof computing local cv, and other score-raising and training techniques for you to understand and learn!

3. The task requirements and reference code can be found in the corresponding folder under the current folder, and the code section can also be accessed and run directly on the Kaggle platform.
